User Story

Project Description: Build a web app that generates jokes based on userâ€™s preference/interest/region/time of day

User Story: As a person living in this 2020 Covid era, who needs some humor, I want to have access to a bank of jokes so that I can cheer up my family/friends, dazzle my online dating matches, be popular in my place of work, and strengthen my washboard abs of comedy.

Functionality:

Locational Jokes - When the user types in the state he/she lives in, a joke will pop up about his/her home state, most likely an insulting joke. If the user misspells a state or doesn't type a state from the US, no joke will show up. Whatever the user types will be transitioned to lower case so the joke generator will work.

Joke of the Day - When the user hits the "click to start" button, the joke of the day will pop up and the "click to start" button will disappear. If the joke is a question and requires a punchline, the user can click the "click for punchline button" to reveal the punchline. The button will also disappear on the reveal.

Random Jokes - When the user clicks the "click to start" button, a random joke will appear in the text, but the button will remain on the screen because the user can click this button as many times as they'd like to keep getting new jokes. There is also a "need a punchline?" button just in case the joke is a question. Upon clicking the "click to start" button again, the punchline text from the previous joke will clear. Also, it is impossible to click the punchline button if there is no punchline.

Chuck Norris Jokes - When the user clicks the picture of Chuck Norris, a random Chuck Norris joke will generate. The user can click his picture as many times as they'd like to keep getting new jokes.

Dad Jokes: When the user clicks the picture of the dad mowing his lawn, random dad jokes will generate. The user can click this picture as many times as they'd like to keep getting new jokes.

HappyHour Jokes - When a user clicks the picture for Happy Hour, a random ADULT joke will generate. The user can click his picture as many times as they'd like to keep getting a different joke.

Silly Sounds - When a user selects one of the audio buttons, they will receive a comedic sound in return.

Design: Bulma CSS framework used for an efficient and organized layout - Navbar with section navigation and burger for easy mobile access - Tile layout for clear joke segmentation - Buttons and inputs for user interactions - Footer including extras and email contact. Colorful and interactive design
